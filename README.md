The circle (drinking) game.

Circle is a game most optimally played with 5 or 6 people, all sitting in a circle, facing each other.  Players all do a simple 1-2-clap beat, and on the clap, one player throws their unique sign; they then on the immediate next clap, throw another player's sign.  The game continues until someone makes a mistake interpretting or throwing signs, and you have to take a drink.
